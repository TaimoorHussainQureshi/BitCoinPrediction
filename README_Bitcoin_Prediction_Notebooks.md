# Bitcoin Price Prediction Notebooks

## Overview
This collection includes two Jupyter Notebooks (`BitcoinPred.ipynb` and `BitCoin Prediction.ipynb`) focused on the task of predicting Bitcoin prices using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Data Extraction and Handling**: Utilizing libraries like `ccxt` for downloading and handling cryptocurrency data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing historical Bitcoin data to understand trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models to forecast future Bitcoin prices.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of data and predictions to better understand the results.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- CCXT for cryptocurrency market data.
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and other visualization libraries.
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras) for predictive modeling.

## Installation
To work with these notebooks, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install ccxt pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
# Add any other necessary package installations here
```

## Usage
Run the notebooks (`BitcoinPred.ipynb` and `BitCoin Prediction.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment to explore the methodologies for Bitcoin price prediction. The notebooks contain detailed comments and code explanations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relevant Python libraries as mentioned above.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to these notebooks by enhancing their features, improving the prediction models, or refining the data analysis techniques.

## License
